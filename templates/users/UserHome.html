            The “Paysim” dataset from Kaggle, a well known online community has been used for analysis and detection of
            frauds. This is a synthetic dataset of Online payment transactions consisting of nearly 6.4 million rows of
            data. The entire 6.4 million rows data has been segregated into five majorly identified transaction types :
            CASH-IN, CASHOUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT and TRANSFER. The task was to find out the types in which frauds mainly
            occur. The transactions are classfied as “fraudulent” and “genuine” using binary classification analysis.
            The overall flow of this module can be visualized in Fig. 1. The dataset was found to be quite skewed, thus
            for proper analysis data pre-processing is done.

            There is a lack of public available datasets on financial services and specially in the emerging mobile
            money transactions domain. Financial datasets are important to many researchers and in particular to us
            performing research in the domain of fraud detection. Part of the problem is the intrinsically private
            nature of financial transactions, that leads to no publicly available datasets.

            We present a synthetic dataset generated using the simulator called PaySim as an approach to such a problem.
            PaySim uses aggregated data from the private dataset to generate a synthetic dataset that resembles the
            normal operation of transactions and injects malicious behaviour to later evaluate the performance of fraud
            detection methods.

        <h3 style="color: White;">Description</h3>
        <span style="color: White;"> PaySim simulates mobile money transactions based on a sample of real transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. The original logs were provided by a multinational company, who is the provider of the mobile financial service which is currently running in more than 14 countries all around the world.</span>

        <h2 style="color: White;"> Headers</h2>
        <span style="color: White;">This is a sample of 1 row with headers explanation:</span>
        <ul style="color: White;">
            <li>1,PAYMENT,1060.31,C429214117,1089.0,28.69,M1591654462,0.0,0.0,0,0</li>
            <li>step - maps a unit of time in the real world. In this case 1 step is 1 hour of time. Total steps 744 (30
                days simulation).
            </li>
            <li>type - CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT and TRANSFER.</li>
            <li>amount - amount of the transaction in local currency.</li>
            <li>nameOrig - customer who started the transaction</li>
            <li>oldbalanceOrg - initial balance before the transaction</li>
            <li>newbalanceOrig - new balance after the transaction</li>
            <li>nameDest - customer who is the recipient of the transaction</li>
            <li>oldbalanceDest - initial balance recipient before the transaction. Note that there is not information
                for customers that start with M (Merchants).
            </li>
            <li>newbalanceDest - new balance recipient after the transaction. Note that there is not information for
                customers that start with M (Merchants).
            </li>
            <li>isFraud - This is the transactions made by the fraudulent agents inside the simulation. In this specific
                dataset the fraudulent behavior of the agents aims to profit by taking control or customers accounts and
                try to empty the funds by transferring to another account and then cashing out of the system.
            </li>
            <li>isFlaggedFraud - The business model aims to control massive transfers from one account to another and
                flags illegal attempts. An illegal attempt in this dataset is an attempt to transfer more than 200.000
                in a single transaction.
